- refactor: Improves code without changing external behavior, including code formatting and removing redundancy.
- style: Changes that affect the style of the application, such as CSS changes that alter the frontend look without impacting functionality.
- chore: Routine tasks that don't modify the application code or test files, such as updating dependencies.
- revert: Reverses a previous commit, useful for quickly addressing issues introduced by recent changes.
